## Getting Started

To get started with Movie Keeper, you can clone the project repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone <link>
cd folder
npm install
```

You will also need to create a RapidAPI account and get an API key for the Movie Database Alternative endpoint. Once you have your API key, create a .env.local file at the root of the project and add the following line with your API key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-rapidapi-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=host-here
```

You can then run the app in development mode using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.
```

## Deployment

Movie Keeper can be deployed on Vercel using the hobby plan. To deploy the app, create an account on Vercel and link it to your GitHub repository. Once you have linked the repository, Vercel will automatically deploy the app when you push changes to the main branch.
